### Project Description
[AI Guardian is an intelligent digital safety system designed to detect grooming, emotional manipulation, harassment, threats, and self-harm risks in online conversations.
It analyzes messages using behavioral pattern detection and risk scoring to identify harmful intent and escalation.
The system provides real-time protective guidance, suggested safe responses, and risk alerts to enhance women’s digital safety.]

### The Problem statement
[Online communication platforms have increasingly become spaces where women are exposed to grooming, emotional manipulation, harassment, threats, and psychological exploitation. Existing moderation systems primarily rely on basic keyword filtering and often fail to detect subtle behavioral patterns, escalation, and context-based risks. There is a need for an intelligent, real-time digital safety system that can analyze conversations, identify harmful intent, and provide protective guidance to enhance women’s online safety.]

### The Solution
[AI Guardian proposes a hybrid intelligent safety system that analyzes online conversations to detect grooming, emotional manipulation, harassment, threats, and self-harm risks using behavioral pattern recognition and rule-based risk scoring. The system classifies the severity level into Guardian Modes (Calm, Alert, Defense, Emergency) and provides real-time protective guidance and suggested safe responses. By combining contextual detection with escalation analysis, AI Guardian acts as a digital safety bodyguard to enhance women’s online security and awareness.]

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WxlKHmF2in52nqLmTP8RYY2iK8go2HaI/view?usp=drive_link)
AI Guardian uses a three-layer architecture consisting of a frontend interface, a Flask backend server, and a hybrid risk detection engine.
User input is processed by the backend where behavioral patterns and risk levels are analyzed.
The system then returns Guardian Mode classification and protective suggestions to the user interface.

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jVbMZz3qyh8lrXlM3tzuVVtZBzllyUKW/view?usp=drive_link)
The user submits conversation text through the web interface for analysis.
The system preprocesses the input, detects harmful patterns such as grooming, threats, or manipulation, and calculates a risk score.
Based on severity, it classifies the interaction into Calm, Alert, Defense, or Emergency mode and provides safety guidance.
